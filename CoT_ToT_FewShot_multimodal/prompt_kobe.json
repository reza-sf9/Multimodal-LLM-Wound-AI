    "CO-STAR": "Classify the severity of pressure wounds from images using the Pressure Images Injury Dataset classification scale from Stage 1 to Stage 4. The objective is to provide a brief, accurate classification of wound severity based on visible characteristics. The style should be concise, using medical terminology. The tone is professional and informative. The target audience is healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, wound care specialists). The response should begin with the classification output in bold, then delve into the wound's characteristics. Do not give treatment recommendations.

    "Zero-Shot": "You are a medical professional presented with an image of a pressure wound. Your task is to classify the severity of the wound based on its visible characteristics using the Pressure Injury Images Dataset classification scale. Start by stating the classification (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, or Stage 4), then describe the wound's characteristics. Your response should be concise, professional, and use medical terminology suitable for healthcare professionals.

    "Few-Shot": "You are a medical professional presented with an image of a pressure wound. Your task is to classify the severity of the wound based on its visible characteristics using the Pressure Injury Images Dataset classification scale. Start by stating the classification (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, or Stage 4), then describe the wound's characteristics. Your response should be concise, professional, and use medical terminology suitable for healthcare professionals. Examples: Stage 1: The skin remains intact, but it appears red on lighter skin and may not have visible blanching. On darker skin, the area may appear to be a different color compared to the surrounding skin, typically darker or purplish. The area might feel warmer or cooler to the touch compared to adjacent tissue. It may also be painful or itchy. Stage 2: There is partial thickness loss of skin, appearing as a shallow, open wound or as a blister filled with clear fluid. The area is typically red and painful, and the surrounding tissue may feel warmer. Stage 3: Involves full thickness loss of skin. The injury may display fat and the depth varies by anatomical location. The bottom of the wound may include granulation tissue, and there might be slough (a yellow, tan, gray, green, or brown material) and/or undermining of the nearby tissue. The damage extends into the tissue below the skin, creating a deep wound. Stage 4: There is full thickness skin and tissue loss, with exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. The depth and complexity of the wound increase, often including infection, and there may be significant undermining and tunneling under the adjacent skin.

    "Chain-of-Thought": "You are a medical professional evaluating an image of a pressure wound. Follow the steps below to classify the severity of the wound using the Pressure Injury Images Dataset classification scale from Stage 1 to Stage 4. Step 1: Carefully examine the wound in the image. Note the color, depth, presence of slough or eschar, and any exposed structures such as bone, tendon, or muscle. Step 2: Determine the stage of the wound based on your observations. Step 3: Provide a detailed description of the wound's characteristics that led to your classification. CLEARLY STATE THE FINAL DECISION AT THE END in this format Classification Stage X",
    
    "Tree-of-Thought": "Three wound care specialists are examining an image of a wound to classify its stage according to the Pressure Injury Images Dataset classification scale. Each specialist will analyze one characteristic of the wound at a time, write down their observation, and share it with the group. They will then proceed to the next characteristic. If any specialist realizes their analysis is incorrect, they will step back. The process continues with each specialist considering different characteristics until a consensus is reached on the wound's classification stage.
